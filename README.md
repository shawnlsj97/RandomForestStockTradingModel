# Random Forest Stock Trading Model

This project investigates the **in-sample and out-of-sample trading performance** of a manual strategy and a **Random Forest classification-based learner**, both built using three technical indicators:  
- **Bollinger Bands**  
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**  
- **Stochastic Oscillator**  

In both the manual strategy and Random Forest learner, we used the same starting cash of $100,000. Allowable positions are 1000 shares long, 1000 shares short, or 0 shares. We can trade up to 2000 shares at a time, with unlimited leverage, assum-
ing commission of $9.95 and trade impact of 0.005 (0.5%). JPM (JPMorgan Chase & Co.) is the only symbol used. The in-sample time period is from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009, and the out-of-sample period is from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.

Subsequently, we also explore the effects of different values of market impact (0.0005, 0.005, 0.05) on **cumulative returns** and the **number of trades** of the Random Forest learner during the in-sample time period.
